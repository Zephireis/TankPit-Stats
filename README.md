TankPit-Stats uses the application programming interfaces (api) from https://tankpit.com/api and https://discord.com; it uses those apis to display players account statistics and posts it to a chat channel inside of discord with a command function written in python. The functionality also includes chat commands to display account information; kills, deaths, timeplayed, ect and a reputation system based on in game performance and saves data to a mySQL database and assigns their discord ID to a tank they register. It also includes moderation and fun commands.

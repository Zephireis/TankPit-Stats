TankPit-Stats uses apis from tankpit.com and discord to display players tank statistics into a chat channel on command from a user in the chat channel.
The Funtionally includes chat commands to display account tank information kills, deaths, timeplayed, ect. Which is also added into a mySQL database so that data can be used for other functions such as linking tanks from the game to a discord server member so they can be added to a repuatation system.
